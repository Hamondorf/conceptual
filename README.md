# conceptual
C++20 concepts go brrrrr.

A library adapting preexisting type_traits into concepts, as well as improving upon the preexisting standard ones with better subsumption (I think).
A better README and project overview soon to come.

Concepts are prefixed with "req_" similar to how a lot of type traits are prefixed with "is_", I'll explain my reasoning later.
